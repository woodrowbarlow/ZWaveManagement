This is a list of minor problems which might need attention. These are
considered pretty minor since this bundle is more about proof-of-concept than
providing a final product. To see the big-picture goals, see the various readme
files.

There seems to be a resource leak somewhere. I suspect it is improperly utilized
resources when I switched RxTx to jSSC. More specifically, I suspect it is a
mis-use of the SerialInputStream / SerialOutputStream objects, which are not
synchronized for use in threads.

The bundle doesn't stop properly. The code does stop responding to input, but
the bundle just kind of hangs before changing state.

If you start the bundle without the controller plugged in, we need it to exit
more gracefully. Currently it throws an NPE and crashes.

Maybe we should have a "homepage" for when the user opens the web interface but
hasn't selected a node yet. It could either default to the controller node, or
display a message that says "please select a node above" and some other stuff.

Page loading takes a while each time a form is submitted. It would be a good
idea to use JavaScript each time a "submit" button is pressed to disable all
form inputs and display some sort of "loading" animation.

After a control is processed, it would be nice if all the parameters weren't
still in the URL (in case the user hits reload in the browser). This could be
solved by making a redirect after processing -- redirect to "?node=X" where X
is the current node's id.
